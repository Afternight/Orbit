CHECKLIST
GRAPHICAL ELEMENTS


**- URGENT FUEL BAR** BACKING DONE
Fuel bar needs (seperate) bar graphic, as in the loading bar bit is seperated from the backdrop etc
Arrows to go around planets 

**- LAUNCH BUTTON **  DONE

which will transform into fuel bar, bar is located in center bottom of screen. Needs to have fuel text or something to make it clear that its the fuel bar

Launch button also needs some kind of power bar on it, unsure as of this time whether this needs to be free-floating to allow manipulation or if it can be graphically part of the launch button. Depending on the amount of this power the rocket will be launched a different amount initially. Might also need somekind of moveable limiter for the bar, as to say that on this level you cannot launch the rocket with any more power. Not to sure about this mechanic yet


**-TARGET INDICATOR**

When the final target is off screen something is going to show up on the borders of the camera pointing towards it, perhaps since we are launching to land on the earth planet this is simply the earth planet miniturised with an arrow. 


**Menu, the planets as actual buttons **
DONE

**- STARTING ASTEROID ** DONE
like a really small asteroid  that is where the rocket starts


**Finishing object**
object that finishes the level when you touch it


**- DESTRUCTION ANIMATION** DONE
(sprite sheet from rocket)


**- PAUSE / RESTART BUTTONS**


**- PAUSE MENU**
like a menu that materialises when game paused. Basic concept of it split into quaters, top right assigned to stats of level atm, other 3 to the buttons for resume,restart,exit to menu //consider removing reset button from pause menu if to much clutter


**Level selection screen**


Code-


decide on launching mechanism


Fuel bar logic


Extra power ups - forcefield etc


Different types of planets, add tag section and code for it


Destruction logic, decide how its going to incident itself
