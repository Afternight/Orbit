GRAPHICAL ELEMENTS


**- NOTHING (triangles) TO LAUNCH BUTTON ANIMATION **

When a level is loaded up, after showing the general space and planet locations the game goes into explore mode, when it enters this mode the user is able to drag and zoom around the level using fingers. When entering this the launch button needs to appear somehow. This can be achieved through the two triangles fading in then spreading out to show the launch button, similar to how the triangles expand from the launch button to the fuel bar

**- ASTEROID TARGET INDICATOR**

Need an indicator like the one used for earth atm, perhaps make the existing indicator for earth and the asteroid one have a wider whitespace to make it a bit more clear its an indicator and is not the planet. New code to be implemented which makes the indicator get smaller the furth the thing to be indicated is away in distance 


**- WIN MENU**

Free roam for this, needs to display the total amount of fuel left, a highscore (the highest amount of fuel left) and something showing the 3 tiers of scores, ie you get bronze for a certain amount, silver for another, gold for higher etc. Also a restart button and a back to menu


**Level selection screen**

Free roam, however need button to go back to menu and a "challenge" (the daily level thing) level button that skips to the challenge level of the day. A total of 30 in built levels are present. Also need to be able to put a border or something around levels to indicate the score level previously achieved, ie I got gold in level 1 so it has a gold medal on it or a gold border or something


**- PAUSE BAR**

During pause its going to allow players to go back into the explore mode and zoom and stuff around the level to see where they are at etc, need somethign to show up thats unintrusive that shows its paused, maybey give a back to menu button as well and seconds of fuel left
