CHECKLIST
GRAPHICAL ELEMENTS

**- ASTEROID TARGET INDICATOR**

Need an indicator like the one used for earth atm, perhaps make the existing indicator for earth and the asteroid one have a wider whitespace to make it a bit more clear its an indicator and is not the planet. New code to be implemented which makes the indicator get smaller the furth the thing to be indicated is away in distance 


**- WIN MENU**

Free roam for this, needs to display the total amount of fuel left, a highscore (the highest amount of fuel left) and something showing the 3 tiers of scores, ie you get bronze for a certain amount, silver for another, gold for higher etc. Also a restart button and a back to menu


**Level selection screen**

Free roam, however need button to go back to menu and a "challenge" (the daily level thing) level button that skips to the challenge level of the day. A total of 30 in built levels are present. Also need to be able to put a border or something around levels to indicate the score level previously achieved, ie I got gold in level 1 so it has a gold medal on it or a gold border or something


**- PAUSE BAR**

During pause its going to allow players to go back into the explore mode and zoom and stuff around the level to see where they are at etc, need somethign to show up thats unintrusive that shows its paused, maybey give a back to menu button as well and seconds of fuel left
