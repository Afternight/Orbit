Repo for the Orbit mobile application project

While this repo is public, it is purely for demonstration purposes. The code and graphical assets wherever possible remain the property of Afternight, failure to recognise this by copying or using the contents of this repository elsewhere without permission will lead to prosecution to the maximum extent of the law

I always wanted to type that "maximum extent of the law" it sounds so overly menacing or something
