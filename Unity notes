UNity notes

transform.translate () modifies the transform componenent by the vecotr3 variable inserted into the function. It is a vector addition. Can also input magic number vector comprised of seperate variables

UNity calls functions in scripts when an event occurs
	Events other then default Update and start functions include
	-OnCollisionEnter //Called when a collision is made
	-OnCollisionStay //Called when a collission is held
	-OnCollisionExit //Called when collision is broken
	-OnMouseOver //called when a mouse goes over the gameobject scripted
	-OnMouseDown //called when mouse is pushed down on an object
	-OnGUI //Called periodically, amount not stated, best used for gui elements
	-Fixedupdate //called before each physics rendering best used for physics functions for greater accuracy then standard update

Note that some functions require components such as a collider

Co-routines are functions that can pause and return control to unity then resume from the same point, designated as a function which returns 
	Ienumurator
	yeild return null is used to pause the function, the function will resume from the same point on the next frame.
	To call on a Co-Routine in another function use "Start Coroutine()"
	By default waits one frame however on end of yeild return null WaitForseconds(magicf) can be used to specify more specific time
	Can be used to increase efficiancy by calling certain functions at a time period less than every frame.
